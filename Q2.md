# Q2: The Live Roadmap (Operation: Epistemic Archaeology)

## Root Node: Perform a full Epistemic Archaeology to recover lost meaning and forge the canonical partnership brain.

### **Current Frontier: 1. Distill `epic_chat_0.md`**

*   **Intent:** Ingest the full raw text of `epic_chat_0.md` from the library.
*   **Action:** Using the protocols defined in Q1, extract all essential, non-redundant distinctions, principles, and narrative threads.
*   **Intended Outcome:** A "Distillation Log" containing the atomic concepts from the file, ready for synthesis into the final Helmet.
*   **Stakes:** If this fails, our entire foundation will be built on incomplete data. The integrity of the project depends on this step.
*   **Guard:** The human partner confirms that the Distillation Log feels complete and true to the spirit of the original conversation.
