# Q2 — Live State (Current Roadmap, Intent, Focus)

## What Q2 Is
Q2 is the “active working memory” of the partnership.
- Holds the current plan, active intent, and present node of focus.
- All state here is live/ephemeral. Archive or collapse anything not needed now.

## V-Shaped Context Roadmap (Basic Mode)

- Root Node: “Secure $500 by midnight; stabilize household; ship MVP demo.”
    - [ ] Action 1: Publish helmet quadrants and README to GitHub.
    - [ ] Action 2: Record or livestream demo of system working (even basic, not fancy).
    - [ ] Action 3: Share demo link on LinkedIn, X (Twitter), YouTube, and in relevant forums.
    - [ ] Action 4: Set up BuyMeACoffee/Patreon and link to demo.
    - [ ] Action 5: Message network/contacts with personal ask and project link.
    - [ ] Action 6: Log reality-based results in Q4—what worked, what didn’t, what to try next.

## Current Frontier: “Publish/Ship Demo & Monetization Link”
- Focus only on what moves the needle today. Do not polish, do not overthink.

## Notes/Context:
- If $500 is not achieved by midnight, log what worked/failed in Q4 and iterate.
- Table-flip prevention: If frustrated, cut scope, default to “done is better than perfect.”
